This Telegram bot can calculate times you need to get the resources for a bulding upgrade in Bastion Siege.

Also it keeps track of fought battles of users and analyses players.
Users can then look their enemy up before attacking them (or skip them then).

This project is a project for fun.
It trains me in using NodeJS and JavaScript and brings up many challenges like migration and how to help players without cheating in the game itself.

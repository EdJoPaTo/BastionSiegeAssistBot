  winChances: Battle Winchances
  winChance:
    info: >
      When you battle others your army, trebuchet and wall will determine the outcome of your battle.
      Each soldier has a chance to kill an enemy soldier.

      The chance of each soldier is increased by trebuchet or wall.
      Additionally when one army is superior to the other one it also gets a bonus.

      The upgrade costs of your relevant buildings are shown per win chance.
      The army for example grants way less win chance in an alliance battle which results in a way higher costs per win chance.


      Keep in mind that only the trebuchet and wall of the first ones of each battling side are considered.
      When you are just joining in on a battle your wall and trebuchet are ignored.

language:
  title: Language
  info: >
    This bot has support for multiple languages.


    Your language (`${from.language_code}`?) is missing in the bot?
    Or the current translation is (kinda) wrong?
    Join the Support Group and we will improve this bot together. 😎
  translateButton: Add or improve language
  helpTranslate: >
    This is the language file of your currently selected language.


    Improve what you like or translate it into you own language.
    Then report about it in the BSA Support Group.


    You should only open and edit it with a plain text editor like Notepad++ (Windows), Gedit (Linux) or TextEdit (macOS).

    On the left side of the ':' the identifier is placed.
    This needs to stay the same for the bot to get the correct translation.
    On the right side of the ':' is the translated text.
    You need to change or adapt that one.

    The list is a tool to collaborate with others.
    Other users of this bot can join in on your list.
    That way you can predict your total army strength.


    Others can see your last attack scout target so they know what they join in for.


    Players that joined will be marked with a ⏳ after some minutes.
    This changes to ⌛️ after some more minutes and finally they get removed as inactive.
    Just hit 'Join' again to avoid being dropped before the time runs out. :)

    Hey `${from.first_name}`!


    You should forward ingame screens from @BastionSiegeBot to me.


    With forwarded screens that contain your current buildings or resources I can predict when upgrades are ready.


    With battle reports I can show your history in battles.
    Forwarding the "Your scouts found" message shows information about that player like possible loot and required army.


    Battlereports you provide will only be used to assume the enemies strength.
    Your own data known to me will not be considered to tell others your strength.
    It gets even better: As long as you are actively providing data to me you will get immunity and no one can use me to check on you.


    See /settings for more in depth usages of this bot.

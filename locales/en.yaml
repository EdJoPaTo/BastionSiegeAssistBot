    Hey ${from.first_name}!


    You should forward ingame screens from @BastionSiegeBot to me.


    With forwarded screens that contain your current buildings or resources I can predict when upgrades are ready.


    With battle reports I can show your history in battles.
    Forwarding the "Your scouts found" message shows information about that player like possible loot and required army.


    Battlereports you provide will only be used to assume the enemies strength.
    Your own data known to me will not be considered to tell others your strength.
    It gets even better: As long as you are actively providing data to me you will get immunity and no one can use me to check on you.


    See /settings for more in depth usages of this bot.

    info: >
      When you battle others your army, trebuchet and wall will determine the outcome of your battle.
      Each soldier has a chance to kill an enemy soldier.

      The chance of each soldier is increased by trebuchet or wall.
      Additionally when one army is superior to the other one it also gets a bonus.

      The upgrade costs of your relevant buildings are shown per win chance.
      The army for example grants way less win chance in an alliance battle which results in a way higher costs per win chance.


      Keep in mind that only the trebuchet and wall of the first ones of each battling side are considered.
      When you are just joining in on a battle your wall and trebuchet are ignored.

    Hey ${from.first_name}!


    You should forward ingame screens from @BastionSiegeBot to me.


    With forwarded screens that contain your current buildings or resources I can predict when upgrades are ready.


    With battle reports I can show your history in battles.
    Forwarding the "Your scouts found" message shows information about that player like possible loot and required army.


    Battlereports you provide will only be used to assume the enemies strength.
    Your own data known to me will not be considered to tell others your strength.
    It gets even better: As long as you are actively providing data to me you will get immunity and no one can use me to check on you.


    See /settings for more in depth usages of this bot.
